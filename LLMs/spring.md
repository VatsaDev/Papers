# SPRING: Studying the Paper and Reasoning to Play Games

## Abstract
 - Open-world survival games are challenging for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements.
 - RL is popular for solving games, but its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Minecraft
 - Read the crafter paper, and use that to reason for playing minecraft
 - Deploy a graph with llm game related questions
 - Use CoT and in-ctx reasoning

## Spring
 - Two stage approach
    - Read crafter paper, make a knowledge graph
    - reason over knowledge graph, make in game descisions
