*not a paper, but also influential

 - creating, planning, executing tasks
 - give it a predefined objective, it breaks tasks down into steps
 - hard to keep all details/steps in ctx, retrieve prev actions as nesc. from vectorDB
 - FOXY method
    - main objective
    - reflection
    - task list creation
    - final output of task-list
    - update objective or mark completed


## future work
 - currently text only, incorporate other modalities (text, video, audio, code, sound, action)
 - websearch info, realtime updates
 - fleshout better frameworks, milestones, etc
 - longer ctx models, RWKV/SSMs maybe?
 - security/safety checks of an action
 - collaboration with other ai/humans
