# CiCERO

## Intro
 - first human level diplomacy the game player
 - strong long-term strategic reasoning/planning
 - overall loop
    - figuring intent, guessing the other players actions
    - communicate with other players
    - reach agreements with others
    - plan with alliances, and execute it

## Details 
 - overall structure of diplomacy
    - seven-player board game, each player is a european power in WW1, the only way to win is by working with other players to capture as much territory as possible
 - open-ended language/action allows for a much more powerful strategy than prev. versions
 - two parts
    - language model
    - planning engine (strategic reasoning algos)
 - LLM conversations are grounded in the plans of the strat algos, making dialogue beneficial for both you and the allies
 - strat algos get info from the dialogue to estimate other players actions and plan accordingly

## future work
 - expanding Cicero into a full metaverse agent, integrating powerful ai into VR
 - does starting with a narrative in the beginning, being eccentric, help?
