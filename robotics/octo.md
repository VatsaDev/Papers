# Octo: An Open-Source Generalist Robot Policy

## Intro
 - low generablizity across robots in ai, most are for a specific robot with a specific task
 - more robot data has resulted in more generabilzity
 - General purpose exists for nlp/cv, needed for robotics
 - Octo is supposed to be a generalist robot policy, a baseline like transformers?
 - task-observation-action loop

## Octo
 - t5-base for text, conv for images, shallow image encodings
 - trained on 25 robotic datasets

## future work
 - better instructions
 - wrist cams
 - more data
 - more generalization
